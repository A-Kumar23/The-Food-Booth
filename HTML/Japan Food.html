            IWashoku, or traditional Japanese cuisine, is based on local, pure
            and fresh ingredients. Rice, fish, vegetables and wild plants are
            accurately prepared, often according to strict rules. The flavours
            are usually mild, occasionally quite strong and sometimes quite
            strange to a Western palate. This mix ensures that Japanese cuisine
            continues to fascinate, both at home and abroad.

            The Japanese chef is precise and driven. He often prepares the same
            dish year in, year out, as a result of which the Japanese cuisine as
            a whole has become refined and perfected. Over the centuries,
            Japanese people have built up a great culinary tradition. This
            tradition was recognised by UNESCO in 2013 when it was added to the
            list of intangible (“living”) cultural heritage.Japanese restaurants
            are also super-specialised. Contrary to what we are used to in the
            West, you won’t find an extensive selection of different dishes in
            most Japanese restaurants. If you feel like okonomiyaki, you go to
            an okonomiyaki-ya, for sushi you must be in a sushiya, or in a
            kaitenzushi, where the sushi rolls on a conveyor belt. Only in
            izakayas, informal food and beverage outlets, and teishokuya, where
            they serve set menus, is the choice somewhat more extensive.
            However, Japanese restaurants in the West usually have a wide
            selection of dishes on the menu.

            For centuries, Japan was a “closed country” (sakoku), shut off from
            outside influences. Foreigners were not allowed into the country and
            Japanese were not allowed to casually venture abroad. Contact was
            only permitted in a few port cities. Japanese cuisine remained pure
            and authentic for a long time, until the Japanese came into contact
            with Portuguese and Dutch traders, for example, they ate no meat.
            Eventually, once the government allowed it, the Japanese embraced
            many Western dishes and methods of preparation, including
            deep-frying, the use of batter (tempura) and breadcrumbs (tonkatsu),
            noodles (yakisoba) and noodle soup (ramen).

          <h3>Typical ingredients</h3>

            Rice forms the basis of every meal in Japan. The Japanese love it
            and eat it in many forms, from onigiri to mochi (rice balls and
            elastic dough balls). Japanese rice (japonica rice or Japanese
            hakumai) is a short-grain rice that is firm and slightly sticky
            after cooking. It must be rinsed well several times and then soaked.
            Chefs don’t agree on which of these two steps is the most important,
            so it’s best to take both seriously! After cooking, the rice needs
            to sit for the water to evaporate for less than fifteen minutes. To
            make shari (sushi rice), cook the rice in dashi (broth). While the
            rice is still warm, the sushi sushizu (sushi vinegar) is shoved
            through with one hand, while the rice is tossed enthusiastically
            into the cool air. The faster the rice is cooled and the vinegar is
            absorbed, the shinier the grain. The rice should be served lukewarm,
            shaped into sushi. It should not be suddenly cooled. Our Western
            supermarkets, where the sushi is pre-packed in the fridge, have
            missed that lesson.

            There are numerous ways in which soybeans are used in Japanese
            cuisine. Completely pure, young and fresh from the plant as edamame,
            for example, or fermented as natto, shoyu (soy sauce) or miso. Tofu
            is made from curdled soy milk, which can then be grilled (atsuage)
            or deep-fried and used as a cover (aburaage). Even the skin that is
            produced from cooked soy milk is eaten.

            Japanese cuisine does not really include sauces as we know them but
            uses a lot of liquid flavourings.
            <br /><br />
            Shoyu (soy sauce) is the best known. This sauce, made from good
            quality soybeans, roasted crushed wheat, sea salt and spring water,
            is used in small quantities – never too much, that would be too
            dominant – to add umami.
            <br />
            Rice vinegar is essential for making sushi rice and is often mixed
            with other seasonings to make dipping sauces, dressings or
            preserving liquids.
            <br />
            Sake and mirin are rice wines, and mirin is sweeter than sake. Both
            wines exist in different qualities; some can be drunk as is; others
            are used for cooking.
            <br />
            Sushizu (sushi vinegar, also known as awasezu) is a mixture of rice
            vinegar, sugar, salt and mirin or sake.
            <br />
            Dashi is Japanese broth. It forms the basis for many dishes, from
            miso soup to takoyaki. Dashi is made from kombu (kelp), katsuobushi
            (bonito flakes) and sometimes niboshi (dried sardines). The result
            is a broth full of umami that gives a flavourful basis for soups,
            sauces, rice and batter.

          <h3>Good table manners</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mid-para">
          <p>
            In India, dishes are placed in the middle of the table and shared.
            It is rude to keep a dish all to yourself. Moreover, you will miss
            out because you will lack the multitude of flavours and textures
            that complete an Indian meal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Place a serving spoon in each dish so that nobody has to put their
            own spoon in a common dish. Doing so would “contaminate” the dish.
            The same applies to naan: never tear off one piece and then put the
            rest back.
          </p>

          <p>
            Respect the food on your plate by scooping up no more than you can
            eat, and then eat it.
