        <h3>Indian cuisine</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="top-para">
        <p>
          India is vast. More than half the size of Europe and number two in
          the world when it comes to the number of inhabitants (nearly 1.3
          billion). However, wherever you are, color appears on your plate.
          Vegetables and legumes play an important role in the diet – about 30
          per cent of the population is vegetarian. People also like to use
          spices, preferably many different ones at the same time. This
          creates dishes that are complex in taste and smell. Add to this the
          many regional variations of dishes, and you will understand that
          Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse.

          If you take a look at the kitchen of an Indian restaurant, you could
          think that people in India only eat curries. Yet this is not the
          case. From stews and stir-fries to pancakes and biryanis, India has
          much more to offer than just curries. Did you know that curries can
          also be dry or soupy

        <h3>Influences</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mid-para">
        <p>
          The north of the country is known for its tandoori dishes – chicken
          tandoori for example – and rich, creamy dishes, such as chicken
          korma. Thanks to the temperate climate, wheat grows well, with the
          result that people usually eat bread with meals: naan, roti, chapati
          or puri. The bread is perfect with the thick sauces from the
          northern regions, often based on yoghurt.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the south, the climate is suitable for growing spicy chilli
          peppers, sour tamarind, coconut and rice. Here, people love hot
          food. The sauces are often somewhat more liquid and go well with
          rice: the rice absorbs the sauce without losing its firmness. The
          rice is not only steamed but is also made into thin pancakes (dosa)
          or steamed rice cakes (idli).
        </p>

        <p>
          Indian cuisine is not only influenced by the climate, but also by
          religion. Many Indians are Hindu and often eat vegetarian or vegan
          foods. In addition, the Mogul rulers of previous centuries have
          brought Islamic practices, such as eating meat and fish. The arrival
          of Christians, including the Portuguese and later the British, has
          ensured that part of the population now also eats pork. Thanks to
          the same Christians, Calcutta even has a traditional Christmas cake
          with rum flavour, while the rest are largely restrained regarding
          alcohol.

        <h3>Typical ingredients</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mid-para">
        <p>
          Spices form the backbone of Indian cuisine: both whole and finely
          ground powder. A list of twenty to thirty commonly used spices gives
          hundreds of possible combinations. In addition, Indian spices are
          also combined into masalas or spice mixtures, each with their own
          application. Chaat masala, tandoori masala and garam masala are
          examples of this. The main spices in Indian cuisine are cardamom,
          clove, cassia cinnamon, black pepper, cumin and coriander.
        </p>

        <p>
          Basmati rice is the rice that grows in (the south of) India. The
          long-grain rice is loose in structure and does not stick after
          cooking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Legumes, such as lentils, split peas and chickpeas, are an important
          source of protein for the vegetarian part of the population and are
          therefore found in many dishes. The best-known example is dahl
          (lentils). Nowhere is the mango as versatile as in India. This sweet
          fruit comes from the Indian subcontinent and is used both raw and
          cooked in sweet, savoury and spicy dishes. Think mango lassi, mango
          chutney, dahl and raita.

        <h3>Good table manners</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mid-para">
        <p>
          In India, dishes are placed in the middle of the table and shared.
          It is rude to keep a dish all to yourself. Moreover, you will miss
          out because you will lack the multitude of flavours and textures
          that complete an Indian meal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Place a serving spoon in each dish so that nobody has to put their
          own spoon in a common dish. Doing so would “contaminate” the dish.
          The same applies to naan: never tear off one piece and then put the
          rest back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Respect the food on your plate by scooping up no more than you can
          eat, and then eat it.
        </p>
