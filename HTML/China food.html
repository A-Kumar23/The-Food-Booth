          <p>
            Chinese cuisine is one of the oldest and most diverse cuisines in
            the world. Two thousand years before the beginning of our era,
            people there ate noodles. Even today each province – there are
            twenty-three in total – has its own cooking style, based on regional
            ingredients and preferences. These range from wildly picked greens
            in the mountains and fresh, salty seafood on the northeast coast to
            the light, sweet accents of Cantonese cuisine. In Central China,
            where chilli peppers are rampant, people love hot spicy food, while
            in Beijing, lamb is a favourite.

            What all Chinese people have in common is that they like variety.
            Just as in Indian and Indian cuisines, China also always serves
            multiple dishes per meal – even on a normal weekday evening. If it
            is a banquet, then all the stops are pulled out. Since many dishes
            already contain a sweet element, desserts are unimportant. You won’t
            see dessert appear on the table very often.

            n Europe, we are most familiar with, and love, Cantonese cuisine
            from the province of Guangdong in the southeast of the country.
            Cantonese dishes, including chow mein and barbecue ribs, are often
            slightly sweet. Ingredients are stewed or braised and the sauces are
            mild because there are not many strong seasonings involved. The aim
            of the Cantonese chef is to preserve the original taste of the
            ingredient used, be it meat, vegetables or fruit. Because relatively
            little sugar, fat or dairy products are used, Cantonese food is also
            fairly slimming.

            Wherever there are historical Chinese populations, there are
            regional adaptations to traditional Chinese recipes. This has led to
            significant developments in fusion cuisines across Europe and
            beyond. Today, Chinese food is known and loved as one of the
            continent’s most popular cuisines. It is widely available in
            supermarkets, while most towns have at least one Chinese restaurant
            offering extensive menus ranging from Cantonese to Szechuan.
            Well-known dishes include crispy duck with plum sauce, shredded
            spring onion, cucumber and pancakes; sweet and sour pork; chicken
            chow mein; beef in black bean sauce, and spring rolls.

          <h3>Typical ingredients</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mid-para">
          <p>
            The taste base of many Chinese dishes consists of garlic, ginger,
            five-spice powder (star anise, cinnamon, clove, Sichuan pepper,
            fennel seed) and roasted sesame oil, made from white sesame seeds.
            Fermented products such as soy sauce, rice vinegar, Shaoxing rice
            wine and fermented bean paste have a strong taste and aroma and are
            usually used in small quantities or processed into a dip, with the
            aim of adding a savoury dose of umami. Sichuan peppercorns, also
            called flour pepper, are typical for Chinese cuisine. These
            citrus-like grains are not actually pepper grains but the skin of a
            very small fruit. They are processed in salt, fried in oil until
            they release their aroma, or roasted in the wok and sprinkled over
            dishes. Pork has traditionally been the main meat ingredient of
            Chinese cuisine. Pigs were the first animals that were farmed for
            food. When Chinese people referred to meat, they were actually
            always talking about pork. And pork is still the star of many
            dishes, including cha sieuw and siu mai. It is stewed, stir-fried,
            steamed and fried.

          <h3>Good table manners</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mid-para">
          <p>
            The guest of honour or the head of the family is in charge at the
            table. As long as he or she remains standing, nobody can sit. And no
            one can start eating until he or she does.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you eat with a group in a restaurant, the numerous dishes are
            often placed on a turntable that sits on the table. This allows
            everyone to turn the desired dish towards themselves and transfer
            something from the bowl or dish into their own bowl.
          </p>

          <p>
            To prevent spills, you can raise the bowl of food to your mouth.
            Pick it up with your thumb and three fingers; the bowl should not
            touch the palm of the hand. Do not bend over the bowl, but sit up
            straight. Bending forward is considered rude and is also believed to
            be bad for the digestive system.
