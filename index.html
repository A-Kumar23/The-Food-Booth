            <p class="h-info">Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the 
                Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, 
                these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.</p>
            <p class="h-info"> Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, 
                cultural choices and traditions.</p>
            <p class="h-info">Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role
                 in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number
                  of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts,
                   and guava have become staples in many regions of India.</p>

            <h3 id="main-head"> <a href="Html/China food.html"> Chinese cuisine </a> </h3>
            <p class="h-info">Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture and includes cuisines originating from 
                China. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many 
                other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such 
                as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be 
                found worldwide.</p>
            <p class="h-info"> The preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in
                 historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also
                  have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical
                   in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of
                    Chinese cuisine. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures
                     have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time. .</p>
            <p class="h-info">There are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and
                 abroad. The most praised Four Great Traditions in Chinese cuisine are Chuan, Lu, Yue, and Huaiyang, representing 
                 cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively.[2] The modern Eight Cuisines of China are Anhui 
                 (徽菜; Huīcài), Guangdong (粤菜; Yuècài), Fujian (闽菜; Mǐncài), Hunan (湘菜; Xiāngcài), Jiangsu (苏菜; Sūcài),
                  Shandong (鲁菜; Lǔcài), Sichuan (川菜; Chuāncài), and Zhejiang (浙菜; Zhècài) cuisines.</p>

            <h3 id="main-head"> <a href="Html/Japan Food.html"> Japanese cuisine </a> </h3>
            <p class="h-info">Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through
                 centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on
                  rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, 
                  pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or 
                  in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, a staple includes 
                  noodles, such as soba and udon.
                 Japan also has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in sukiyaki and nikujaga.</p>
            <p class="h-info"> Historically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine has also opened up to influence from 
                Western cuisines in the modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign food—in particular Chinese food—like ramen and gyōza.
                As well as foods like spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers, have been adapted to Japanese tastes and ingredients. 
                With some regional dishes becoming familiar throughout Japan too, including Okinawan cuisine's taco rice having itself been 
                influenced by American and Mexican food traditions.[1] Traditionally, the Japanese shunned meat because of Buddhism, 
                but with the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as tonkatsu and yakiniku have become common. 
                Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi and ramen, has become popular throughout the world.</p>
